# MusicEncrypt
![](logo.png)
In this project I built with my team in Python for concealing encrypted messages into music file with no distinction in the audio file so if the someone will get the file and listen to it he will not pay attention the file was change only the receiver will know there is a secret message.
However the attacker know the file have a secret message he still not able to read the message because the message is encrypted, 
the encryption was done using deterministic public key encryption RSA.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you will need to install pycryptodome&pillow.
In terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
